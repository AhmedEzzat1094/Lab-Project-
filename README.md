📜 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook Heart_Disease-1.ipynb
Or run Python scripts as needed.

📊 Results
Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

The best-performing model provides reliable predictions for heart disease risk.
